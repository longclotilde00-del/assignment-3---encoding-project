# assignment-3---encoding-project
This repository includes TEI all encoding of three letters directly related to François Truffaut, a french film director, including: a letter from Truffaut to Jean Gruaut, a letter from Truffaut to Georges Delerue, and a letter from Alfred Hitchcock to Francois Truffaut. 
The repository also contains an ODD file, which contains three customizations of encoding rules, adapted to the letter corpus. The three letters are validated against the RNG schema that applies these customizations to the encodings.
The repository also contains an HTML file and an RNG file generated from this ODD customization file, which document my encoding. 
Finally, the repository includes a reflective note on the learning process undergone during the project. 
I used generative AI to help me understand in more details how an ODD works and how the RNG schema links the ODD and TEI encoding.
